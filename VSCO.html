                        <p class="section-text vsco">Overview</p>
                        <p>VSCO is an art and tech company providing photo editing service application.</p><p>This is a school project that we worked in a team of four and partnered with VSCO team to conduct user experience design research. Due to the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with VSCO, some of the research results are not supposed to be disclosed. </p>
                        <li>Time: June - August, 2017</li>
                        <li>Team member: Peter Jones, Tian Li, Zhu (Zoey) Zhu</li>
                        <li>Instructor: Cori Schauer</li>
                        <li>Research methods: quanlitative research, in-person interview, participant design, comparative analysis</li>  
                        <p class="section-text vsco">Research Goals & Objectives</p>
                        <p>We conducted research by analyzing the content on VSCO's website, mainly in the "feed" section. We found the there were mainly two types of content - one is the user-generated content, another is the content originally produced by VSCO. However, those two types of content was not integrated and organized well. We focused our research goals on the later, typically on the event information VSCO released to create a cohesive community among heavy users.</p>
                        <img src="img/VSCO/feed.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> 
                        <p class="caption">"Feed" section on VSCO website.</p>
                        <p>In collaboration with the stakeholers, we set our research goals and objectives in two aspects.</p>
                            <li>Understand VSCO’s offline event participants and how those events impact their involvement with VSCO.</li>
                            <li>Understand how heavy VSCO users want to improve the app’s navigation and how to bring the aspects from VSCO offline events to the app. </li>
                        <p class="section-text vsco">Interviews</p>
                        <p> We conducted 5 in-person interviews. Four were remote and one was face-to-face. All of the interviewees are heavy users and had participated in VSCO events. VSCO provided us with a list of contact information of event participants, and we managed to reach out the following five participatns who met the screening requirements.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>The detailed interview guide as well as information of the participants are confidential because of the NDA. The interview process mainly contains four sections - we began with a brief introduction with some warming questions, then broadly asked questions about their user experience, and narrowed down to specific questions about offline events, and finally invited them for the participant design.</p>

                        <p class="section-text vsco">Findings & Recommendations</p>
                        <p>We figured out 5 key findings after the interviews, and we offered recommendations regarding to each finding. </p>
                        <li>Finding #1: VSCO is a unique place for creatives.</li>
                        <li>Finding #2: Photo editing function is used more than browsing other photos.</li>
                        <li>Finding #3: Instagram is complement, not competitor to VSCO.</li>
                        <li>Finding #4: Users learn about VSCO offline events via emails and stay in contact with people they meet at events.</li>
                        <li>Finding #5: VSCO events are opportunities to experiment with engaging users.</li>
                        <!--Finding 1-->
                        <p><strong class="vsco">Finding #1: VSCO is a unique place for creatives.</strong></p>
                        <p>Unlike Instagram where users have more pressure from "followers" and "likes", the anti-social feature of VSCO enables more space for inspiring and creative ideas. </p>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>I really enjoy VSCO for the simplicity. They don’t focus on how many followers and likes you have. You can care more about your own collection of the photography as you want.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>Sometimes I use VSCO filters to get an idea of how I want to edit my photos. VSCO’s definitely the best at editing.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Users also mentioned other photo editing apps they use in addition to VSCO. Theese are VSCO's counterparts instead of competitors.</p>
                        <img src="img/VSCO/counterpart.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> 
                        <p class="caption">VSCO's counterparts mentioned by users</p>
                        <p class="recom vsco">Recommendations</p>
                        <li>Maintain the feature of “no followers and likes”.</li>
                        <li>Add more high-quality editing filters and make VSCO more differentiated from other photo editing apps.</li>
                        <!--Finding 2-->
                        <p><strong class="vsco">Finding #2: Photo editing function is used more than browsing other photos.</strong></p>
                        <p>Four out of the five interviewees are professional photographers or designers. They use VSCO for mobile photography editing and build the accounts as their portfolio to show their art work.</p>
                        <p>They also mentioned that it was hard to navigate to browse others' photo and find other photographers. Compared with the browsing function, the photo editing function is more intuitive.</p>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>I typically use it for my own documentation. Just basically as a journal for me.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>‘Joystick’ was not the easiest way to navigate app.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                         <p></p>
                        <p class="recom vsco">Recommendations</p>
                        <li>Have more editing functions for detail tweaking.</li>
                        <li>Improve navigation by incorporating the browsing function into photo editing process. </li>
                        <!--Finding 3-->
                        <p><strong class="vsco">Finding #3: Instagram is a complement, not competitor to VSCO.</strong></p>
                        <p>At first we identified Instagram as VSCO's competitor after the discussion with our stakeholders and competitive analysis. But during the research, we found users use VSCO and Instagram for different purposes. Instagram is more like a complement than a competitor to VSCO </p>
                        <p>Users mentioned that Instagram is more personal but less about serious photography. They also have better interactions with other users on Instagram. Compared to Instagram's features like "Storeis", VSCO's collection feature is confusing.</p>
                        <p>We analyzed and compared Instagram and VSCO accounts of the same user, trying to figure out the logic behind their way of interpreting the same photo on different platforms. The first user cropped the photo differently. The second one, added more captions on Instagram, which easily triggered more attention and interaction.</p>

                        <p class="caption">User cropped the same photo differently on Instagram and VSCO.</p>
                        <img src="img/VSCO/captiondif.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> 
                        <p class="caption">User added more captions and hashtags on Instagram but left it blank on VSCO.</p>
                        <p class="recom vsco">Recommendations</p>
                        <li>Simplify hierarchy of the sharing platform.</li>
                        <li>Optimize search function.</li>
                        <li>Use website, offline events and other opportunities to answer questions for loyal users.</li>
                        <li>Make sure users understand what makes VSCO’s social platform great and unique.</li>
                        <!--Finding 4-->
                        <p><strong class="vsco">Finding #4: Users learn about VSCO offline events via emails and stay in contact with people they meet at events.</strong></p>
                        <p>All of the five interviewees said they followed some participants on VSCO after the event. Right now they all learned about the offline events by email invitation, but they would expect to know about the events via more sources.</p>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>Events allow you to connect to people you’ve met online in real life.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>Put an event page in the app would be cool.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>
                        <p class="recom vsco">Recommendations</p>
                        <li>Send an email for the participants after the event with an open entry (link) for them to write down their journals.</li>
                        <li>Post information about the approaching events on social media channels.</li>
                        <li>Post event information on the app.</li>

                        <p><strong class="vsco">Finding #5: Events are opportunities to experiment with engaging users</strong></p>
                        <p>Below are the top things event participants liked.</p>
                        <ul>Sense of community: meeting people in real life</ul>
                        <ul>Exploration: learning something new</ul>
                        <ul>Interaction with respected figures: usually photographers with reputation</ul>
                        <ul>Small sizze: not too many people (like Instameets)</ul>
                        <ul>Visit the office: Oakland & NYC(shutdown)</ul>
                        <h3 class="quote"><strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong>New York office felt like something special and I was sad to see it go.<strong style="font-size:36px" class="vsco">"</strong></h3>

                        <p class="recom vsco">Recommendations</p>
                        <li>Keep hosting similar events including inspirational panels for people who want to break into the photography industry, and use Oakland office as a hub similar to NY office</li>
                        <li>Ideas for future VSCO events</li>
                            <ul>Gallery show for VSCO users to exhibit their photos</ul>

                        <p>To summarize, there are 5 recommendations we concluded that VSCO would apply to its design to engage more users through offline events and increase their user experience with the app.</p>
                        <ol><li>Maintain non-social elements and make features that differentiate it from others.</li>
                        <li>Have more photo editing functions and simplify navigation on social platform.</li>
                        <li>Keep loyal users happy, and take advantage of their personal and social influences.</li>
                        <li>Inform users about the events via more platforms, and follow up with them online and offline afterwards.</li>
                        <li>Organize more offline events and experiment with their format.</li></ol>
