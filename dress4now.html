                        <p>Dress4Now is an integrated online fashion shopping application that optimizes the online clothing shopping experience.</p>
                        <li><strong>Time:</strong> March - May/2018</li>
                        <li><strong>My role:</strong> UX Researcher, UX/UI Designer</li>
                        <li><strong>Instructors:</strong> Catherine Batacan, William Tyner</li>
                        <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> six user interviews, 10 usability testing (four for low-fi, six for how-fi)</li>
                        <li><strong>Research methods:</strong> In-person Interviews, Card Sorting, Comparative Analysis, Affinity Diagram, Prototyping, Wireframing, Usability Testing</li>
                        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Sketch, InVision, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Trello</li>
                        <p>Remember the last time you spent a day in a department store, grabbing clothes and roughly counting the number before an assistant to get into the fitting room? Young female friends around me always complain they didn't have time to go shopping and their wardrobe always lacks a piece of clothing. But the truth that they're easily attracted by an online promotion and open up a fashion app browsing for a whole night.</p>
                        <p>According to <a class="link" href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-fashion-industry">a report by Shopify</a> in 2018, revenue and revenue per user (ARPU) of digital clothing merchants are projected to grow both worldwide and domestically in five years. The U.S. ecommerce fashion industry is expected to grow 8.8 percent while 8.7 percent in Europe and 14.1 percent in China.</p>
                        <p>The reduced digital barrier provided us with a more cnovenience way to shop. However, as ecommerce reshaped how customers interact with the items in fashion industry and created a totally new experience, problems emerge. The increasing return and exchange rates indicate the space to optimize user experience with online fashion retailers.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-text">Problem Statement and Hypothesis</h2>
                        <p>I targeted the users as <strong class="about"> young femalel professionals </strong> aged 18 to 35 as they make up for the majority of online fashion shopping customers. To address the problem, I randomly chatted with my friends falling into this category and roughly came to the first-stage statement as below. </p> 
                        <h4>Problem Statement</h4> 
                        <p>Young female professionals need a way to <strong class="about">get more details</strong> of the clothes online because it will help them get a perfect fit.</p>
                        <p>Young female professionals need a way to get <strong class="about">an organized list</strong> of online clothing products and <strong class="about">customized recommendations </strong>because it will save their time.
                        <h4>Hypothesis:</h4> 
                        <p>We believe that by creating a function that allows customers to <strong class="about">virtually try clothes on</strong> for young female professionals, we will achieve offering the best fit for them.</p>
                        <p>We will know this to be true when we see <strong class="about">higher conversion rates</strong> and <strong class="about">lower return rates</strong>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-text">User Research</h2>
                        <p>I conducted six interviews in total. Three of them were my friends and three were female consumers I interviewed at department stores.</p>
                        <h3>Key interview questions</h3>
                        <li>Can you describe your typical online clotheing shopping habits?</li>
                        <li>How often do you buy clothes online?</li>
                        <li>What are the top 3 reasons you buy clothes online than in store?</li>
                        <li>What are the main platforms you usually buy clothes online?</li>
                        <li>What are the pain points when you shop clothes online?</li>
                        <li>How often do you make returns and exchanges, and why?</li>
                        <li>Any other things you want to add?</li>
                        <h3>Research Findings</h3>
                        <p>I used affinity diagram to analyze all the insights and findings from my user interviews. Overall there are three main painpoints users have with online clothing shopping.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/affinity-diagram.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p></p>
                        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Quality is the first thing users concern about when they shop online. Unline in-store shopping when they're able to touch and try on the items, they can hardly know what exactly the clothing looks like until behind the screen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> This is the biggest reason users choose to shop online, but they also expect more convenience on the ecommerce platform like easy return and exchange policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price:</strong> Price is also the top reasons users go online. Usually there are more promotions and lower taxes than in stores. Users also expect more deals like coupons and cash backs bonus online.</li>
                        <h2 class="section-text">Competitive Analysis</h2>
                        <p>With the research findings in mind, I conducted the competitive analysis by listing the featues of competitors. Bascially there are three types of competitors based on my research.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/competitive-analysis.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p></p>
                        <li><strong>Ecommerce giants like Amazon.</strong> 
                            <p style="margin-left:30px">Although they do not focus on fashion retail, they almost have everything users in need of and the habit of shopping in other departments sometimes triggered users to search for clothing items. They're professional in creating an easy path for people to shop, but not customized enough for fashion shopping.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Online department stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom.</strong> 
                            <p style="margin-left:30px">They typically extend their offline shopping experience to the online platform. While they're expert for its large collection, their digital platforms actually lack some dedicated efforts with UI/UX designs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Fashion retailers like Zara, Urban Outfitters.</strong> 
                            <p style="margin-left:30px">They usually offer a lot of deals and created an online community. They have their own website and mobile platforms that are well-built. But the limitation is that users have to switch if they don't want to shop in a specific brand.</p>
                        </li>
                        <h2 class="section-text">Personas</h2>
                        <p>Based on my research and analysis, I created two personas and revised the problem statement and hypothesis.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/persona1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/persona2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h4>Revised Problem Statement</h4>
                        <p>Young female professionals need a way to <strong class="about">get more details</strong> of the products on online fashion platforms because it will help them have a better knowledge of the <strong class="about">quality</strong> of products and make <strong class="about">reasonable purchase decisions</strong> to get perfect fits.</p>
                        <h4>Revised Hypothesis</h4>
                        <p>We believe that by creating a function that allows customers to <strong class="about">get access to the details</strong> of the clothing products for young female professionals, we will achieve offering <strong class="about">the best fit </strong>for them.</p>
                        <p>We will know this to be true when we see <strong class="about">higher conversion rates</strong> and <strong class="about">lower return rates</strong>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-text">Feature Prioritization</h2>
                        <p>I brainstormed many approaches to solve the problem, and prioritized them using the "effort-impact" matrix. Starting from the "low-effort, high-impact" quadrant, I also tried to tackle some of the "high-effort, high-impact" ones.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/feature-prio.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">User Flow</h2>
                        <p>Creating a user flow enabled me to think logically and integrate all the elements I already had into a happy path. It was much harder than I expected to draft the first flow, partly because of the tedious sign-up steps and the navigation across different brands.</p>
                        <p>After seleveral times of revision, I finally came to the one below. It's close to a normal online shopping path, but I added <strong class="about"> three main features </strong> innovated to optimize the path.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/userflow.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">Site Map</h2>
                        <p>After some card sorting experiments with potential users, I landed on the site map to lay out the information my product would contain. There was no big surprise from the card sorting results as they all expected in line with a normal fashion retailer platform.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/sitemap.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">User Storyboard</h2>
                        <p>An effective way to progress was to sketch out the scenario of how a potential user would interact with my product and what the main screens would be. (Please excuse my bad drawing!) </p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/storyboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">First-stage Low-fi Prototype and Usability Testing</h2>
                        <p>I conducted my first round of usability testing with the four main screens at the very first stage.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/first-stage-low-fi.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p>I conducted my first round of usability testing with <strong class="about">four users </strong> and <strong class="about">two tasks</strong> with the four main screens at the very first-stage.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/user-testing1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p>Overall the usability testing turned out well, but people expected the UI to be more intuitive and more features added to create an end-to-end path.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-text">Low-fi Prototype</h2>
                        <p>With the insights from first usability testing, I expanded the four main screens to more for a more mature low-fi. I linked screens and buttons to show the interaction.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/low-fi.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">MDP Usability Testing</h2>
                        <p>I continued the usability testing all the way along the process from the low-fi to high-fi. Once the main functions were ready, I began to test ignoring the unfinished UI. I found this approach was more effective and flexible than testing after everything is done as it took me less effort to revise. </p>
                        <p>I've done <strong class="about">six usability testings</strong> in total, with <strong class="about">three tasks </strong>. All were offline so that I was able to ask their feedbacks promptly and recorded the whole process.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to the testings, I realized some barriers that I failed to see as an insider, like the floating home button, the placement of "try on in store" function and some detailed UI elemtns.</p>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/user-testing2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <h2 class="section-text">Final Prototype</h2>
                        <p>For the final prototype, I've made <strong class="about">three main revisions </strong>after the usability testings.</p>
                        <li><strong>Redesigned sign up steps</strong>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px">The sign up stage was one of the most challenging parts as I tried to get more preferences from users without bothering them. I revised the UI design to make prioritize the hierachy of each page by moving the "back and step" button to the top and making the font weight smaller. To keep users more engaged, I also added pop-up windows in later steps before they check out.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Modified UI for better accessibility</strong>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px">With so many color patterns experimenting with accessibility and branding, I finally decided to keep the main pages black and white as most online fashion retailers. The biggest challenge for this product is that the information of clothing items is too colorful, thus having my own color is easy to make it overwhelming.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Integrated three main features on the same page</strong>
                        </li>
                        <img src="img/Dress4Now/high-fi.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">

                        <h2 class="section-text">Learnings and Challenges</h2>
                        <p>During this project, I've read <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=YKNT3ED8K71YSGD3H7GF" style="font-style:italic ">Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug and applied some of the methods discussed.
